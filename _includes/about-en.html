<h1>Cardboard Cabin</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p class="lead">
From the remote cabin of Cardboard Cabin, warm, danceable folk music can be heard. Intimate moments are interspersed with strong power folk. The repertoire contains self-written songs: classical ball dances, but the group does not shy away from experimentation. A sanctuary for anyone who wants to get away from the bustle of this busy world.

The brothers Jeroen (accordion) and Andreas (saxes) Werbrouck earned their spurs in the folk world as a duo under the name <a target="_blank" href="https://vi.be/platform/katla"> Katla </a> (winner of the 2016 Music Mosaic Podium, Boombal, Gooikoorts, Queimada,…). In September 2019 they started a new story, together with Flor Delombaerde (<a target="_blank" href=https://www.facebook.com/Isabelleetlesjean/> Isabelle et les Jean </a>, <a target = "_blank" href = http: //tmouvement.be/ \> 't Mouvement </a>) on double bass and Tim Orroi (<a target = "_ blank" href = https: //www.facebook.com/Nitty- Gritty-104290207647653 /> Nitty Gritty </a>, <a target="_blank" href=https://www.facebook.com/pg/Cirquen-fl%C3%AAxe-106122690724429\> Cirqu'en Flêxe </a>) on drums.
